Proponents of gun control argue for stricter regulations to prevent mass shootings and reduce crime, while opponents believe that such measures infringe on constitutional rights and propose that an armed citizenry can better deter crime and offer self-protection. This issue is often brought to the forefront following mass shootings, with calls for legislative action competing against the emphasis on mental health and the safeguarding of constitutional rights.",
